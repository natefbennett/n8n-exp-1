This project uses n8n to automate workflows. The following instructions will help you set up and use n8n effectively.
[n8n documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Synaptiv-AI/awesome-n8n/refs/heads/main/n8n-docs-llms.txt)

This project is intended to be a local development playground for n8n. It is not intended to be used in production.

I want to primarily use Docker Compose to run n8n.

To better understand the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server standard, please refer to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms.txt).

Assume commands are run in PowerShell, unless otherwise specified.
